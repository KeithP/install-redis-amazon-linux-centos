This is a modification of JorgeRdg's version of the original Saxenap's script, optimized for automatic deployment scripts.
It performs an installation of Redis as a service on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk instances. It may probably fit other purposes as well. Just check out 'redis-install-script.sh' file ;)
This version is updated to install the current stable release of redis from redis.io ( instead of 2.6.4 from googlecode ).

Note: Please make sure you have superuser privileges

2. chmod 777 redis-install-script.sh
